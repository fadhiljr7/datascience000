## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing Bitcoin's price cycles from 2010 to 2024. The objective is to break down Bitcoin's market movements into recognizable phases: Bear, Pre-Bull, 1st Bull, and 2nd Bull. Additionally, we apply machine learning (Random Forest Regressor) to predict future Bitcoin prices, focusing on 2025 as a year of potential significance in Bitcoin’s market cycle. The project includes visualizations, insights, and predictive modeling to explore the volatility and patterns within the Bitcoin market.
## File Structure
- Insight and Story.pdf: Contains detailed insights and the storyline of the data, including phase analyses and predictions.
- Dataset.csv: Historical Bitcoin price data from July 17, 2010, to September 14, 2024. Each entry includes the open, close, high, and low prices for each day.
- Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook that visualizes Bitcoin price charts, implements Random Forest Regressor for predicting future prices, and evaluates patterns within the dataset.
- requirements.txt: easy install python depedencies by runing the file.
## Usage Guide
- Cloning Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine with the command: `git clone https://github.com/fadhiljr7/datascience000.git`
